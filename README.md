# apcom - apocalyptic commit messages for the desperate developer

This tool is conceived to fill all your apocalyptic needs in times of desperation. The tool features an awesome algorithm which will generate a dark prophecy accurately describing your feelings. It works through black magic and other hidden/forbidden tricks & stuff.

## Installing apcom

If you have a go environment set up just type:
```
go get github.com/rcoedo/apcom
```

Also, OSX users can use `brew` instead:
```
brew tap rcoedo/tap
brew install apcom
```

## Usage

Just execute `apcom` and you'll get your quote. I recommend aliasing it like this
```
alias gcd=git commit -am $(apcom)
```
